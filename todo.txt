import petools

suspend_input flag
check each visible object to see if clicked, set variable 'selected_*objecttype*' to that object
map from unit to tile function, should be in main.py
range description for moves, should be more than just distance
generate nature and resources on neutral team
skill animations on target selection. one at user, one at target. both are optional and only appear if the anim's attr isn't None
highlight tiles in range of the pending move with solid rectangles
on comp turn: comp select unit, then from options after they are generated (it cannot click)
